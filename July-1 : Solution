3330. Find the Original Typed String I
solution:
class Solution:
    def possibleStringCount(self, word: str) -> int:
        groups = []
        n = len(word)
        i = 0
        
        # Step 1: Get consecutive character groups
        while i < n:
            j = i
            while j < n and word[j] == word[i]:
                j += 1
            groups.append((word[i], j - i))
            i = j
        
        # Step 2: For each group, consider reducing it (only one time allowed)
        # We start with the original string itself counted once
        count = 1
        for char, length in groups:
            if length > 1:
                # We can create (length - 1) new strings by reducing this group
                count += (length - 1)
        
        return count
