Solution:
class Solution:
    def matchPlayersAndTrainers(self, players: List[int], trainers: List[int]) -> int:
        players.sort()
        trainers.sort()

        i = j = res = 0
        n, m = len(players), len(trainers)

        while i < n and j < m:
            if players[i] <= trainers[j]:
                res += 1
                i += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                j += 1  # Trainer can't train player[i], try next trainer

        return res
